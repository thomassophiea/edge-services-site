- Make sure database schema was run successfully
- Check Supabase project is active (not paused)

### Network Rewind shows "No Data"
**Fix:**
- Wait 30-60 minutes for data collection
- Check GitHub Actions logs for errors
- Verify Supabase has data: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM service_metrics;`
- Check browser console for errors

### Railway deployment fails
**Fix:**
- Check build logs in Railway dashboard
- Verify `package.json` is correct
- Make sure all dependencies are listed
- Try redeploying: Deployments → Redeploy

### UI doesn't show Network Rewind component
**Fix:**
- Make sure you're on the Service Levels page
