## 🎬 What Happens After Deployment

### Immediate (After deploying to Railway):
- ✅ Web app is live and accessible
- ✅ Users can access EDGE interface
- ✅ Network Rewind component visible (shows "No Data" initially)

### After 30 minutes:
- ✅ GitHub Action runs first collection
- ✅ First data point stored in Supabase
- ✅ Still shows "No Data" (need multiple points)

### After 60 minutes:
- ✅ 2-3 data points collected
- ✅ Network Rewind shows time slider
- ✅ Can drag slider to view historical data
- ✅ **Feature is fully operational!** 🎉

### Ongoing:
- ✅ Collects every 30 minutes automatically
- ✅ Builds 90-day history
- ✅ Auto-cleanup keeps storage low
- ✅ Zero maintenance required

---

## 📊 What You Can Do With Network Rewind

Once deployed and collecting data:

1. **View Past Performance**
   - Drag time slider to any point in last 90 days
   - See exact metrics from that time
   - Compare historical trends

2. **Investigate Issues**
   - "When did the problem start?"
   - Look at metrics before/during/after incidents
   - Correlate events with performance changes

3. **Track Improvements**
   - See impact of configuration changes
   - Measure performance over time
   - Validate optimization efforts

4. **Plan Capacity**
   - Identify usage patterns
   - Predict future needs
   - Plan infrastructure upgrades

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Change Collection Frequency

Default is 30 minutes. To change:

**In GitHub Actions workflow** (`.github/workflows/metrics-collection.yml`):
```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '*/30 * * * *'  # Every 30 minutes
  # Change to:
  - cron: '0 * * * *'     # Every hour
  - cron: '*/15 * * * *'  # Every 15 minutes
```

### Add More Services

Just add them in Campus Controller - they'll automatically be picked up by the collector.

### Extend Retention Period

In `supabase-schema.sql`, change the cleanup policy:
```sql
DELETE FROM service_metrics
WHERE timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days';
-- Change to: '180 days' or '365 days'
```
